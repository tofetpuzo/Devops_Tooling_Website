# Devops_Tooling_Website
This project entails the use of DevOps tools that will help team in day to day activities. In this project I will implement a solution that consists of the following components.  The Tooling Website informs stakeholders on the activities of users in the platform using these various tools

The tools we want our team to be able to use are well known and widely used by multiple DevOps teams, so we will introduce a single DevOps Tooling Solution that will consist of:

1. Jenkins – free and open source automation server used to build CI/CD pipelines.
2. Kubernetes – an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.
3. Jfrog Artifactory – Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers. Artifactory.
4. Rancher – an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage Docker and Kubernetes in production.
5. Grafana – a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.
6. Prometheus – An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.
7. Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.


The step-up for this infrastructure involves the following

1. Infrastructure : AWS
